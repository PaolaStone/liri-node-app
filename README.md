# LIRI Bot
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How it works?
LIRI can take in one of the following **commands** and the [user entry]:
-	**concert-this**  __U2__
-	**spotify-this-song** __complicated__
-	**movie-this** __avatar__
-	**do-what-it-says** __user entry is entered from a file__

## Information that would be displayed
### node liri.js **concert-this U2** __U2__
![ concert-this U2](images/cconcertThis.png)

### node liri.js **spotify-this-song** __complicated__

### node liri.js **spotify-this-song** (If there is no input from the user, it displays a default song information)

### node liri.js **movie-this** __avatar__

### node liri.js **movie-this** (If there is no input from the user, it displays a default movie information)

### node liri.js **do-what-it-says**

### node liri.js

## Technology
This project was built with JavaScript, and Node.
