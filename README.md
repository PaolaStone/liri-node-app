# LIRI Bot
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How it works?
LIRI can take in one of the following **commands** and the [user entry]:
-	**concert-this**  [U2]
-	**spotify-this-song** [complicated]
-	**movie-this** [avatar]
-	**do-what-it-says** [user entry is entered from a file]

## Commands execution samples
### node liri.js **concert-this U2** __U2__
